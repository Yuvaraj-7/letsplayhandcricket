# 🏏 Hand Cricket Game

This is a simple and fun **Hand Cricket Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I created this project to practice JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation while recreating a game we all played during school days 😄.

##  About the Game
Hand Cricket is a number-based game played between the player and the computer.
- Both choose a number (1–6)
- If both numbers match → **OUT**
- If they don’t match → number gets added to the score

Simple rules, but surprisingly fun!
